# AoC 2022 Day 5 (part 1) animation
This is an animated solution to the part 1 of Day 5 of the 2022 Advent Of Code challenges, was asked to share the code so here it is.

First time trying to draw something in the terminal, so it's a bit messy, but it works.

The problem can be found here: https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/5

The input file is named `input.txt` and is in the same folder as the script (must obviously be in the same format as the given challenge input).

You can tweak the `delay` variable to change the speed of the animation. Too fast and it can start blinking.

Done with f-Strings only and ANSI escape sequences as I didn't know about the [curses library](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html) before haha, will definitely try using that next time.

I'm trying to get better at Python, so please feel free to suggest anything that I could have done better (100% sure there are a ton of them) ,or if you have a question.

## Using
```python solve_pretty.py```
